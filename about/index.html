            <h3>Education: Audio Alchemy</h3>
            <p>I received my Bachelor's of Science in Recording Arts with a Computer Music concentration at the Jacobs School of Music. There, I immersed myself in the dark arts of digital signal processing, by combining my love for media technology with my life-long passion for art music. By graduation, I'd acquired over 4,000 hours of practical experience in audio engineering.</p>
