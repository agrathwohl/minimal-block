Today, I released my first npm module. It's nothing revolutionary, but it may help you out if you're looking to easily calculate a video file's bits-per-pixel using only FFmpeg. Check it out on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bpp).

The reason for creating this module is simple: FFmpeg does not provide this valuable measurement in the output of its otherwise stellar `ffprobe` tool. Luckily, it does provide all of the data necessary to do the calculation yourself, so I went ahead and made this convenience module to save myself time. An added bonus is that you don't need to install mediainfo on your production box!
